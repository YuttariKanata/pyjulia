How it works
------------

PyJulia loads the ``libjulia`` library and executes the statements
therein. To convert the variables, the ``PyCall`` package is used.
Python references to Julia objects are reference counted by Python, and
retained in the ``PyCall.pycall_gc`` mapping on the Julia side (the
mapping is removed when reference count drops to zero, so that the Julia
object may be freed).
